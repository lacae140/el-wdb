    <h1>Assignment for Week 9</h1>
    <article>
        <p>For my final project I have chosen to continue working and continue to enhance my current Portfolio site.</p>
        <h2>Enhancements I would like to improve:</h2>
        <p>I would like to make the images from the gallery interactive when you scroll through them.</p>
        <p>I would like to show more work that I have done that includes more material such as a magazine.</p>
        <p>I would also like to include videos in my site.</p>
        <p> I would like to reorganize it and keep on playing with the layout.</p>
