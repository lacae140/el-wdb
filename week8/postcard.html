            <p>Now that I have the opportunity to live in New York, my friend from Nicaragua asked me to do certain activities that were on her bucket list. Since she could not make it, she asked me to go to a Library, go to central park, go to Dominique Ansel Bakery, go to the Neue Gallery amongst other things. The activity that I chose to depict on the Postcard was going to the Guggenheim Museum and going over works of art that my friend and I had previously studied together. I was just astonished by the building and the remarkable architecture of the museum, it definitely stood out from its surroundings. What I decided to illustrate on the postcard was the curvature of the Museum, the architecture that distinguishes it from any other. The upper background is black, depicting depth and how I felt about the environment, giving it a outer space like feeling. The lower half is my own version of a Kandinsky, an artwork that was on exhibition, one my friends and I favorite artwork.</p>
