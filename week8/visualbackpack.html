        <p>As we explore upon the topics of self, identity and memoir, we were given the task of creating a visual backpack that would represent our taste, personality and priorities. Besides creating the backpack, we needed to produce three more items that would represent each of the following: a memento, a practical item, and a future item. I made my backpack out of three different materials: a plastic bag, wire, and wool. The plastic bag represented my past, my home country, how Nicaragua is full of trash everywhere. Ironically my family is very eco friendly, and therefore the use of plastic also represents that, how we need to recycle and stop using plastic. Then, I folded wire around the bag symbolizing my present, how Iâ€™m digging in into the future, experimenting and discovering new things, mending my way around. At last I used wool as the straps. In Nicaragua, they use wool to make artisanal decorations and native items. Furthermore, in my future I hope to be an artist and designer using wool as well in my creations, tying my home country to wherever my career takes me, which is why the wool is the straps, tying the backpack together.</p>
        <p>For the three items inside the bag I made ballet shoes out of clay, which depicts my past. Ballet was a huge part of my life, since I danced almost everyday since little. I chose the glasses to represent the present, glasses are something that I use in my daily life and they are also a symbol for the present, I want to be able to see my future clearly. At last, the scissors illustrate the future, they give an idea to what I want to be doing in the future. I want to be involved with design in one way or another, creating and coming up with ideas, cutting and pasting, different creative thoughts.</p>
