            <p>For Studio Fashion class, I was given the assignment of deconstructing a discarded blue jean and constructing it into a new garment that would represent my own unique take on the ‘Americana’. Through research and observation of denim and american fashion, I had to come up with a short collection that defined my take on ‘Americana’, define my core values of the collection, and specify the client I am targeting.</p>
            <p>The piece of my collection that I decided render was a headband. The reason that I chose to do the headband was because it is a detail of an outfit, an accessory. This small and simple garment represents my whole collection. It is primary made out of denim and has sparks of color. The fact that it is a headpiece describes the type of client that I am approaching. Someone simple, yet elegant. Headbands are known to be a fashion accessory used to hold your hair away from your face, they are an adornment that women use to add-on to their outfit, to groom their hair and to be neat at all times.</p>
            <p>My collection is targeted to young women. Women that are simple, feminine, elegant and want to be comfortable at all times. I am approaching a classic with a modern twist look. I want to create outfits that women do not feel entrapped in, an outfit that they feel comfortable wearing all day, that doesn’t stop them from doing their chores and errands, and yet, feel stylish and graceful.</p>
            <p>Relation to Seminar Reading: Davis, Fred. “Blue Jeans.” In Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writes, 5th edition, 101-108. Edited by Sonia Maasik and Jack Solomon. New York: Bedford/St. Martin’s Press, 2006. This article highlights the evolution of jeans and how they have come to serve all type of people. How history has shifted and meanings have changed due to the evolution of society and our culture. “The garment underwent a process of cultural authentication that led to its acquiring meanings quite different from that with which it began.” I relate this article to my collection because it is key to look at the past and learn from it in order to be successful in the future. I want my collection to be modern, yet still hold that antique look. My aim will be to create this collection that doesn’t feel that is tied to a time period or to a type of person. Just as jeans have become to be the most flexible piece of clothing, I want my collection to feel really easy to use and dress up and that suits a variety of people. However, at the end of the day is all about marketing and how the fashion world approaches you and sells you the product that convinces you to wear it. “Framing the garment’s status dialectic was the contest of polarities, one pole continuing to emphasize and extend blue jeans “base-line” symbolism of democracy, utility, and classlessness, the other seeking to reintroduce traditional claims to taste…”</p>
