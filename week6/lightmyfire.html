            <h3>Cafe Steinhof</h3>
            <p>This was a matchbox packaging design project with the goal of serving as a memento for the place, capturing the ambience and characteristics that make the restaurant distinguishable. The venue that I was assigned to go was Steinhof Cafe, located in Brooklyn. The place was very peculiar, filled with Austrian and German posters. As I went and documented the place, I had to bring back to class a series of pictures to use for the making of my matchbox. The final four images that were chosen, I had represent them in one way or another in each matchbox, whether it was directly using image and typography, or indirectly through the use of color.</p>
